# Instagram Username Checker
1. install the python libraries: colorama,requests
2. pip install colorama
3. pip install requests
4. run main.py

DISCLAIMER!
This is just a base of a simple username checker on instagram and pretty easy to work on, you can add your proxies threading and more to make it even faster, you will get a username check every 2.5 seconds due to the code not having proxies and to avoid ratelimits.
